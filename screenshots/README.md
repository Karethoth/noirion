# Automated Screenshots

This directory contains automatically generated screenshots of the Noirion application.

## How It Works

Screenshots are automatically generated by:
- **GitHub Actions** - On every push to `main` or `develop` branches
- **Playwright** - Browser automation captures the UI in various states
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - The `.github/workflows/screenshots.yml` workflow

## Running Locally

To generate screenshots on your local machine:

```bash

cd src/backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start frontend

## Manual Workflow Trigger
